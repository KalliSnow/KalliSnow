I'm interested in evolving as a programming student!
I'm currently studying C language, databases, and of course a lot of programming logic.
If you want to contact me,
I'm very active on Instagram @kalli.snow send a message there.
A curious thing about me is that I like to learn different skills at the same time... I love it, I don't know how to explain it but I'm extremely curious about technology topics
